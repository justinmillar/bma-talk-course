# Brief background on Malaria 

.pull-left[
- In 2016, approximately 216 million cases and 445,000 malaria deaths

- Nearly half the world's population is at risk

- Millennium Development Goals outlined specific targets for control/elimination

  * Significant funding investments (US and Worldwide)
  
  * Led to dramatic decreases in disease burden

???

- Over 90% of cases occur in SSA 
- Nearly 95% of moralities occur in children < 5 years in SAA
- $2.7 billion US in 2016
- ITNs, IRS, ACT

???

- Progress made since 2000, estimated 2 million lives saved
- Nearly 50% reduction worldwide
- Despite this progress, many regions continue to experience high transmission rates and disease burden
- Example district in northern Ghana

- Describe data: ~12,000 children over six biannual surveys
- High degree of spatial heterogeneity 
- Rainy season: 20-30% urban areas, 70-80% rural areas (10 km)
- Near universal bed net coverage, IRS
- Drives need for targeted interventions
- Need for comprehensive evaluation of risk factors on a local level

# Too much information can be a problem

.pull-left[
- Possible Models = $2^P - 1$

- If $P$ is large, this can be a huge number

- Increased risk of over-fitting

- Several important qualities to consider:
  * Interpret ability
  * Predictive Ability
  * Complexity
  * Uncertainty

???
- Too much predictive or explanatory info can create big problems
- explain over-fitting
- outline why each of these properties are important
- need for variable selection: step wise regression, ridge, lasso

## Bayesian Model Averaging


![](img/bma-fig.png)

???
- An alternative approach to variable selection
- actually model selection
- works by randomly adjusting the model, fitting the parameters, and averaging

- Repeat over and over (10,000 iterations)

# Outputs

???
- 29 covariates (imaging trying to create individual models)
- Credible intervals
- observations: classic patterns, distance measures
- are there more complex patterns? Seasonal dependencies? nonlinear relationship?

# Overfitting?

???
- after adding all of these additional covariates, is our model still any good?
- out-of-sample prediction
- season to season prediction
- Logistic Regression and Lasso

# Accessing Prediction Performance

```{r predict, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

model <- c(rep("Base Model (p = 29)", 3), rep("Enhanced Model (p = 73)", 3))
method <- rep(c("Logistic", "Lasso", "BMA"), 2)
likeli <- c(-1022.49, -988.92, -976.47, -1061.66, -1026.95, -975.06)

dt <- data.frame(Model = model, Method = method, Likelihood = likeli)


ggplot(dt, aes(x = Model, y = Likelihood, fill = Method, label = Likelihood)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(-960, -1075), oob = scales::squish) +
  geom_text(position = position_dodge(width =  0.9), size = 4) +
  ylab("log Likeihood") +
  theme_classic()

```
???
- Explain the graph (values)
- Both Lasso and BMA are also way better than Logistic
- Some instances were Lasso slightly outperformed BMA for base model
- BMA always out-performed Lasso for the extended model

# Conclusions

Risk Factor Analysis

- Classic pattern of malaria risk factors (e.g. age, wealth) observed in the Bunkpurugu-Yunyoo data set
- Modest urban centers have a significant effect on early childhood malaria prevalence
- Age-related risk was more significant during the dry season
- Distance to nearest urban center and health facilities were significant nonlinear risk patterns

Application of BMA

- Flexibility: Models can be adjusted to account for complex patterns
- Interpret ability: Individuals parameters can be directly related to dependent/outcome variable
- Uncertainty: Credible intervals are easily constructed
- Prediction: Outperformed logistic regression and was resistant to over-parameterization
